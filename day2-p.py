# 1.How Python Stores the values in its memory?
"""
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. 
That is when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
Python optimizes memory utilization by allocating the same object reference 
to a new variable if the object already exists with the same value.
